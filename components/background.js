        Studied physics at BUAP where I learnt my first programming language (C++98). From there I began a journey seeking myself to get into some kind of software and programming development using physics.
        The first thing I developed was an LHC detector simulation from then I wrote programs about computational simulation theory where it all ended in my undergraduate thesis in molecular simulation. <i className="fas fa-rocket"></i>
